# Virtual Neural Signal Simulator

Neural Signal Simulator developed as part of UCLA SURP2020

## Overview

* `mouse.py` uses a pygame interface to collect user cursor movement data.
* `signals.py` contains functions for generating and plotting neural signals.
* `spikes.py` calls functions in mouse.py and signals.py to simulate neural signals according to the user's cursor movements.

## In Progress

* As of 9/2/2020, defining characteristics (min/max firing rates, PD) of the n neurons generated by the simulator are hard-coded 

## Credits

This project was conducted as part of UCLA Summer Undergraduate Research Program under generous guidance of Professor Jonathan Kao. References were taken from his Neural Signal Processing course at UCLA.
